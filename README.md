## What is Pong?

Pong is one of the oldest video games ever made (initially from 1972!). Two pads, one ball. One misses the ball - the other one gets one point.

## Description

This is my first iOS game project I made using SpriteKit framework. 
I implemended three scenes in total - main menu, game scene and game over screen which automatically change dependently on user's inputs.
It's a single player game so the other pad is controller by highly intelegent AI (which follows the ball position automatically).
I added retro looking custom font and coressponding 8-bit sound effects and suitable music to follow the retro vibe.
Scoreboard counts the points for both the player and the AI. Whoever gets to 3 points first, it wins.
Clickable buttons, with animation, included for Start Game and Play Again.
Added simulated play in the background of the Main Menu scene.
